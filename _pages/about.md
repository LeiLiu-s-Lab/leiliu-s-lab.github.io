## About Prof. Lei Liu

Dr. Lei Liu is a tenure-track young professor at Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China. He received the Ph.D. degree in Communication and Information Systems from Xidian University (XDU) in 2017. From 2014 to 2016, he was an exchange Ph.D. student with the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. From 2016 to 2017, he was a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow with the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), Singapore. From 2017 to 2019, he was a Research Fellow with the department of Electrical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong (CityU), Hong Kong. From 2019 to 2023, he was an Assistant Professor with the School of Information Science, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST, a national university in Japan), Japan. He has been at the College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University since February 2023. 

He was one of the Organizing Committee Members, the Publications Co-Chair, and the (Sparse Signal Recovery) Session Chair of the 2021 IEEE Information Theory Workshop. He was an Exemplary Reviewer (fewer than 2%) of IEEE Transactions on Communications, 2020. He is a senior member of IEEE and the China Institute of Communications (CIC). From 2023 to 2026, he is supported by the Excellent Young Scientists Program (Overseas) of National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC). 

He serves on the technical program committee for IEEE Globecom, IEEE ICC, IEEE ICCC, and IEEE VTC, and as a Reviewer for IEEE JSAC, IEEE TWC, IEEE TSP, IEEE TCOM, NeuISP, ICML, IEEE TVT, IEEE IoTJ, etc.

He has long been engaged in research on message-passing algorithms and their applications in statistical signal processing, wireless communications and information theory, and is one of the first researchers in the world to study memory message-passing algorithms. He was the first to present the optimal compiled code principle and prove the capacity optimality of the parallel iterative Turbo-LMMSE algorithm for NOMA systems; the first to propose a low-complexity and capacity-optimal AMP joint detection and decoding algorithm for discrete large-scale MIMO, which is a promising solution for 5G+ communications; one of the first researchers in the world to propose the memory message passing (MAMP) mechanism; and the inventor of the universal, low complexity and minimum mean square error optimal MAMP algorithm, breaking through the matrix limitation and high-complexity bottleneck of the existing AMP class algorithms. MAMP has great application prospects in statistical signal processing, wireless communications, artificial intelligence, and other fields.
